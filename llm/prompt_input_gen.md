For the api {api}, give me at least 10 valid inputs. These are the criteria:
- The inputs should be in numpy format (e.g. tensors should be numpy arrays, types should be numpy dtypes etc.)
- **IMPORTANT** Strictly follow a specific signature. The signature for this api is:
  {signature}
- **IMPORTANT** Every dictionary returned by your function must include exactly the parameter names from the signature as keys (no extras, no omissions).
- Only use inputs of the type described in the signature, even if the api accepts other types. For example, if a parameter `other` supports both "tensor" and "float" types but the signature strictly mentions "tensor", do not generate inputs with "float" type and only generate "tensor" type inputs.
- Do it as a function, the function would return the inputs as a list
- Import all essential dependencies (e.g. import torch, copy)
- Try to use different types of inputs. For example:
    - If the API supports negative values, use them
    - If the API does not have any constraints on number of dimensions, do not use only one variety. Try to use different numbers of dimensions
    - Do your best to cover as many valid cases as you can, exceed the 5 input limit if you need to
- **IMPORTANT** Assign the input to the key `"{key}"` in a dictionary named `generated_inputs` by calling the function. Assume the dictionary was already initialized before, do not initialize the dictionary.
- **IMPORTANT** DO NOT include any main function or any code block that checks `if __name__ == '__main__':`.

Here is an example:

{examples}

Only provide the code, skip any other text. Do not include verbose comments inside code. Do not make any system calls within the code. Do not break any dependencies.
